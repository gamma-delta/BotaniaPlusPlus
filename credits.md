# CREDITS
Thank you to:
- Vazkii, for making Botania and providing a wonderful API. Without that, this project couldn't exist.
- The Forge team, for their MDK.
- MinerArcana, for Floralchemy, a little mod that showed me how to implement my own flowers.
- And you! Thank you so much for playing my mod.

## Tools
Tools and apps used to make this project:
- The mod was programmed with IntelliJ, a Java IDE. Much better than Eclipse IMO
- Assets were made in Asesprite, but I can also recommend paint.net, which is free. Resolute Spectrolus texture is modified from Botania's Spectrolus.
- I first tried learning to mod from videos. Don't try learning to mod from videos. The official Forge tutorial on readthedocs is a little obtuse but the best resource I've seen (it got me to here!). After that, find a mod that's doing something similar to what you're doing, read its source code, and try things out.
