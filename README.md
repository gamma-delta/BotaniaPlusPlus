# Botania++

Hello! Welcome to my first Minecraft mod.

Right now, there's only one item: the Resolute Spectrolus. It's like a Spectrolus, but it eats concrete instead of wool (and makes a lot more mana.) More to follow...

This mod requires Botania (obviously) and AutoRegLib, another mod by Vazkii.
